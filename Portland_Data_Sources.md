# Portland Move Data Sources

In order to find locations, we will use the following resources.

1. Ice Rinks - There are only two, so these will be entered manually
2. Girls High School Water Polo - Use https://www.maxpreps.com.  We can then 
scrape the data from the webpage and use google to look up high school
addresses.
3. Use Foursquare to find moderatly priced resturants with great review.
Map these onto the map.
4. Map the Intel Hawthorn Maps location manually.  

Once all of this information is avialalbe, it will all be mapped onto
a single map which can be navigated.
