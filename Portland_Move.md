# Moving to Portland

My family and I will be moving to Portland, OR in the summer of 2020.  With
two teenagers, picking an optional location of where to live will be critical
to making sure everyone is happy with where we choose to move.

There are four main criteria for our move:

1. Location of hockey rinks - My son is a hockey player, so understanding 
where the local hockey rinks are is important as hockey is a time consuming
sport.
2. Location of Girls High School Water Polo - My daughter is a Water Polo
player.  She will be a junior in highschool and is really wanting to play
on a water polo team.  Not all high schools have Girls Water Polo, so we
will need to figure out which ones have the sport.
3. We love to go out and eat.  But with four people to feed, we want to make
sure we are getting our moneys worth.  So we will be looking for moderatly
priced restaurants with lots of good reviews.
4. Finally, my job will be at Intel's Hawthorn Farms sight, so we will want
to make sure we know where that is on the map.

The idea is that we will map all of these locations onto a map, and then
choose optimal areas of where we might end up moving.
